INVESTIGAR TODO EL TIEMPO

- No es una buena practica hacer el STYLE dentro de HTML, es mejor crear una pgina que style.css aparte y ahi hacer todo el diseño
- Si tengo varios documentos y quiero usar el mismo estilo en todos, tendria que copiar y pegar lo mismo (MALA PRACTICA)

    <h1>Cuttlefish</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Cuttlefish, or cuttles, are marine molluscs of the family Sepiidae. They belong to the class Cephalopoda which
        also includes squid, octopuses, and nautiluses. Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the cuttlebone, which
        is used for control of buoyancy. They have large, W-shaped pupils, eight arms, and two tentacles furnished with
        denticulated suckers, with which they secure their prey. They generally range in size from 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10
        in), with the largest species, the giant cuttlefish (Sepia apama), reaching 50 cm (20 in) in mantle length and
        more than 10.5 kg (23 lb) in mass.[3]
    </p>
    <p>
        Cuttlefish eat small molluscs, crabs, shrimp, fish, octopuses, worms, and other cuttlefish. Their predators
        include dolphins, larger fish (including sharks), seals, seabirds, and other cuttlefish. The typical life
        expectancy of a cuttlefish is about 1–2 years. Studies are said to indicate cuttlefish to be among the most
        intelligent invertebrates.[4] Cuttlefish also have one of the largest brain-to-body size ratios of all
        invertebrates.[4]
    </p>
    <p>
        The Greco-Roman world valued the cuttlefish as a source of the unique brown pigment the creature releases from
        its siphon when it is alarmed. The word for the cuttlefish in both Greek and Latin, sepia, now refers to the
        reddish-brown color sepia in English.

    <h2>Nomenclature</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The "cuttle" in "cuttlefish", which is itself sometimes used to refer to these animals,[5] is derived from the
        Old English name for the group, cudele. The word may be cognate with the Old Norse koddi (cushion) and the
        Middle Low German Kudel (rag).
    </p>
    <p>
        116 species of cuttlefish are currently recognized;[7] for decades, the classification of this family relied on
        just three genera: Metasepia, Sepia, and Sepiella, with Sepia containing most of the species and several
        subgenera.[citation needed] A 2023 paper shifted this perception by having recovered Sepia as containing several
        monophyletic groups or clades. The authors subsequently revived several synonymized genera and elevated some
        subgenera of Sepia to full genus level, reassigning many species of Sepia to these revived genera. Conversely,
        Metasepia was found to nest within one of these revived genera, and as it was named after Ascarosepion it became
        a junior synonym of that genus.[8]

    <h3>Fossil Record</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The earliest fossils of cuttlefish are from the end of the Cretaceous period,[10][11] represented by Ceratisepia
        from the Late Maastrichtian Maastricht Formation of the Netherlands.[12] Although the Jurassic Trachyteuthis was
        historically considered possibly related to cuttlefish,[13] later studies considered it to be more closely
        related to octopuses and vampire squids.[14]
